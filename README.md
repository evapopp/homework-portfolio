# Portfolio

## Objective 
Welcome to my professional portfolio which I have created during my time in the University of Oregon Fullstack Bootcamp. The site includes a brief bio on the "About Me" page, a "Portfolio" page displaying some of the projects I have created, and a "Contact Me" page which has linked my github, linkedin, email and resume. This site was built using HTML and CSS technologies.
