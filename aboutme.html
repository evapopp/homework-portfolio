            <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
            <h3>
                <p>I hail from the midwest <i>(yep I'm a Sconnie)</i> where I grew up playing every sport my parents would enroll me in. I continued on to play soccer in college and decided to pursue my love for physical activity and sport by majoring in Kinesiology. Upon graduation, I moved to Oregon and worked in the physical therapy field for five years. During that time I found myself interested in the tech field, yet feeling quite intimidated and underqualified. After hearing about coding bootcamps and their embracement of students with little to no experience, I decided to enroll with University of Oregon's Full Stack program and pursue a career in web development. </p>

            <h2>Who Am I Outside of Class?</h2>
            <h3>
                <p>I have completely fallen in love with Oregon and all that it holds, and I am always itching to explore more.  Therefore, you can usually find me camping in the mountains, hiking new trails, or adventuring on bike. </p>
               
                <p>My other love is ultimate frisbee. In addition to competing on an elite women's team based in Portland, I was also signed to a women's professional team and made the US Women's National Team in 2020.
